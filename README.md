# The Restaurant App

An application for managing the chaos of a commercial restaurant.

## Introduction

As the manager of a Michelin star restaurant, you need to make sure that your restaurant is operating at peak performance. Like any restaurant, you have a kitchen, a set menu (listing entrees, etc. and detailing their ingredients), and a pantry (storage of all ingredients, refrigerated or not). Recently, you have been bothered by two things: updating the menu is a hassle, it changes every night, so you're always a bit nervous that last night's menu might make it out by mistake; and the kitchen gets congested on busy nights, servers wait for meals to be finished, with no idea when the food will be ready, and sometimes the kitchen misses orders (perhaps due to a paper ticket falling to the floor, for example) which is entirely unacceptable at your restaurant!

You need a solution. And you know right where to go! The Sage CRE QA team will surely be able to create a digital solution to solve your problems.

You put in a request for a system with following requirements.

## Requirements

- The system shall have the menu easily available for reference
- The system shall track orders from when they come in, to when they are finished, including which table ordered which items
- Orders will be processed in an orderly fashion, the first order to come in should be the first order to be sent out (it is safe to assume all orders take roughly the same amount of time to prepare)
- The system need not provide a UI, you have a mediocre UI dev (named John or something) who can create it, but it should be able to be utilized by a variety of modern technologies

_Note_: Menu items are identified by name, but completed they are a combination of their ingredients.
